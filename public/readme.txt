#Welcome to the GHC in Under 5 site!

This site is a collection of  women in technology themed articles from 
sessions I attended during the Grace Hopper Celebration, 2020.

The content is intended for anyone interested in burgeoning technoloies 
and in advocating for the advancement of women in STEM fields.

##About this site
In keeping with the women in technology theme, I decided to use
newly learned React development techniques to build the site.
