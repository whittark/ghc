                  <h3>The high cost of processing medical record exchanges</h3>
                  <p>Despite a 100% adoption of electronic health records (EHR) in the US, 75% of medical record and document exchanges still rely upon faxed transmissions.</p>
                  <p>When a fax is received, clinical staff must manually process these documents and file them within a patient's chart. This job consumes a lion's share of their time, when ideally, their focus should be on patient care.</p>
                  <p>To help our clients, athenahealth captures the information from faxes and attaches this data to the patient's record. athenahealth also handles the management of faxes on behalf of our clients by training employees to capture information in a timely and accurate manner.</p> 
                  <p>Our organization processes more than 150 million faxes per year and the number is only growing. In 2017, athenahealth was spending approximately 2.3 million hours of employee time annually with the fax volume estimated to grow by 40%. If unchanged, the projected cost for this is 3.3 million hours in 2022.</p>
                  <p>This was not a sustainable model from an operational cost perspective. In addition, the costs to train employees was burdensome.</p>
                  <h3>Applying machine learning automation to reduce document processing</h3>
                  <p>The best solution was to employ machine learning (ML) automation to reduce operational costs.  At the heart of this ML automation is the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to read and understand the content of the faxes received.  Specifically, our NLP approach utilized deep learning models to identify and extract document information. These entities were then reported just as a human would report them. The good news was that in 2018, these techniques were mature enough to be deployed at production scale.</p>
                  <p>athenahealth's document processing workflow functions like an assembly line. Each stage represents a part of the entire job to be done, with the incoming document being worked upon in a sequential manner. By studying each stage in the process and applying ML techniques, we were able to considerably reduce processing times that resulted in significant cost savings.</p>
                  <h3>Automated processing stages and results</h3>
                  <p>We applied machine learning techniques at the following process points to significantly reduce manual processing and costs.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b style={{color: 'rgb(88, 44, 131)'}}>Automate categorization:</b> We began by automating the categorization of inbound faxes, with 39 possible options. Result: Machine learning can identify inbound faxes at scale, which is 0.5M documents per day. <p style={{color: 'rgb(88, 44, 131)'}}>With categorization automated, we reduced the processing time to <b>2.8M</b> from 2.9M.</p></li>
                    <li><b style={{color: 'rgb(88, 44, 131)'}}>Automate information extraction:</b> We reduced the time taken to capture data by prefilling easily identified or repeated data for users. Result: High accuracy in the data captured, resulting in faster processing with fewer errors. <p style={{color: 'rgb(88, 44, 131)'}}>This reduced processing hours to <b>2.36M</b> from 2.8M with a savings of 16% in processing time.</p></li>
                    <li><b style={{color: 'rgb(88, 44, 131)'}}>Hide high-confidence information:</b> We hid high confidence automated predictions so that the focus is only on unique, unrecognized data. Result: Further reduction of time in the data capture and QA processing; users only focus on the data that could not be automatically processed.  <p style={{color: 'rgb(88, 44, 131)'}}>This further reduced processing time by 11%, bringing it down to <b>2.1M</b> from 2.36M hours.</p></li>
                    <li><b style={{color: 'rgb(88, 44, 131)'}}>Skip manual QA processing:</b> If all data is captured with high confidence by machine learning, we can skip the manual QA process entirely and make the processing truly "touchless." Result: We can get high quality automation with higher accuracy even if no human QA is done. <p style={{color: 'rgb(88, 44, 131)'}}>This saves an additional 23% in  processing time with the time reduced to <b>1.6M</b> from 2.1M.</p></li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                  <p>Machine learning can automate operations and heavy manual quality (QA) processes, which results in reduced processing times and costs. Within healthcare, these savings further result in reduced healthcare costs and more time focused upon patient care.</p>
