                  <h3>Underrepresentation in STEM workplaces</h3>
                  <p>As a woman working in computer science with a physics background, Dr. Wade was inspired to ask the question. “Why am I the only woman in this computer science and lab setting? Why am I the only person of color here?” </p>
                  <h3>Underrepresentation in education</h3>
                  <p>What we know is that access to computer science education, only 10% of AP students are represented in physics, engineering, and computer science disciplines.</p>
                  <p>High Schools have a hard time recruiting teachers. Girls are more likely to study physics if they go to an all-girls school. This introduces a class bias as well as a gender bias.</p>
                  <p>In the UK, only 35 professors of computer science are black women.</p>
                  <h3>What can we do differently?</h3>
                  <p>Dr. Wade acknowledged that we’ve started STEM programs to reach out to young women to connect with new audiences. But audiences have so many distractions, will they remember these efforts in the long term?</p>
                  <p>What parents, teachers, and girls consume online has the longest lasting impact. Less than one in five main characters are girls and only one in ten are of color. Text books from black women are never represented. </p>
                  <h3>Introducing diverse role models in Wikipedia biography pages</h3>
                  <p>The fifth most frequently visited website in the world is Wikipedia. During the pandemic, it’s an incredible source for non-partisan information. However, the majority of Wikipedia authors are white, male, and living in North America, which is reflected in the content provided.</p>
                  <p>Less than 5% of biographical articles are about women or women of color. Dr. Wade has been supplementing with biographies about women and people of color with over 1,800 pages submitted. </p>
                  <p>An example is the article added about Gladys West, a mathematician featured in the film ‘Hidden Figures,’ who was both a woman and a person of color. Once added, the US government and 200 other authors and editors joined Dr. Wade to add inspiring content with diversity represented.</p>
                  <p>Five million people have since accessed these pages.</p>
                  <h3>Amplifying underrepresented groups</h3>
                  <p>Dr. Wade encourages us to listen and learn about these individuals to push them forward –either as a woman, a person of color, or an ally. We can all affect change for the next generation and lift others as we climb. </p>
                  <p>Dr. Wade also issued a warning and encouragement. As an advocate or ally, we’ll likely receive pushback. She reminds us “Don’t read the comments. Keep going.”</p>

                      <h3>Safeguarding our diversity</h3>
                      <p>The presenters shared that although it’s been proven that diversified cultures outperform, women of color are three times more likely to be regarded as someone of a lower employment level, are two times more likely to have others take credit for their work, and are 1.5 times more likely to leave an organization in response to microaggressions. </p>
                      <h3>Employment resource groups offer a solution</h3>
                      <p>Developing employment resource groups provide a way address these issues.</p>
                      <p>Four keys to ERG development:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Top-down organizational support</li>
                        <li>ERG foundation building</li>
                        <li>Leveraging leaders and influencers</li>
                        <li>Deploying talent ambassadors</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>The panel reminded attendees that it is “a marathon” to set up this structure for both grassroots and top-down leadership development. Be patient as you grow in these areas.</p>
                      <h3>Top-down organizational support</h3>
                      <p>Leveraging organizational support begins with organization-wide awareness from the top. The responsibility isn’t only on the employees. This can be in the form of policies and research groups sponsored by executive leadership. </p>
                      <p>The most effective practice is to integrate the business goals with employee resource goals. This ensures overall company awareness, as it’s a part of the operating rhythm. </p>
                      <h3>ERG foundation building</h3>
                      <p>The presenters expressed that program development is like building a house. You can’t build a house without building a solid foundation. Develop a roadmap for building an inclusive culture. This should also include a method for showing improvement and the benefits of implementation.</p>
                      <h3>Leveraging leaders and influencers</h3>
                      <p>Identify the leaders and influencers in your culture and pull them into the effort. Determine a method to sustain this model of engagement to avoid burnout. These efforts are completed outside of work responsibilities, so leaders and influencers can burn out depending on the professional challenges they face. At Medidata, they found the greatest success by being inclusive and keeping meetings fun and casual with the understanding that people may not always be able to volunteer their time. </p>
                      <p>A committee structure helps with this, which allows membership to fluctuate. It’s great if the committee has a budget and periodic events to recruit additional leaders, influencers and ambassadors.</p>
                      <h3>Deploying talent ambassadors</h3>
                      <p>Talent ambassadors can be leaders, influencers, mentors, or anyone on staff that can assist employees in career growth. This can range from informal sessions where talent ambassadors actively grow the careers of the community in a particular area or as a part of a more formal career growth process. This helps all employees to grow their skills and provides women of color with opportunities to grow.</p>
